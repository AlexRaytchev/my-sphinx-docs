Optiwave's Documentation for Python Electromagnetic Modules (PEM)
======================================================================

Optiwave's PEM is a collection of libraries used for electromagnetic **charachterization and simulation** of **photonic integrated devices**.
It can be used along standard Optiwave's solver like **OptiSystem** and **OptiSPICE** for **circuit and system level simulation**
of photonic integrated circuits.
